Welcome to My Learning Journey  
A personal documentation site for tracking my self-learning progress.

## Why Did I Create This Site?

This site is a place where I document everything I learn during my self-study journey. Whether it's mastering a new technology, exploring concepts, or building projects, all my notes and examples will live here. Here's why I chose to create this site:

✅ Centralized place for all my learning notes  
✅ Easier to review and revise concepts  
✅ Structured documentation for future reference  
✅ A personal space to practice and improve writing and teaching skills  
✅ Simple and organized, powered by modern tech stack

### How I Use This Site

Whenever I learn something new—like creating a server with Node.js or exploring React hooks—I write it down here. Instead of scattered notes in a notebook or random files, I have everything neatly organized and accessible in one place.

This approach helps me:

- Retain knowledge more effectively
- Build a personal repository of useful examples
- Share insights with others who may find them helpful
